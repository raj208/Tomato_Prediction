# 🍅 Tomato Ripeness Prediction App

A Django-based web application that predicts the ripeness of tomatoes using image uploads and machine learning. Built to assist farmers, grocers, and researchers in making data-driven decisions for better crop management.

---

## 🌟 Features

- Predicts tomato ripeness from uploaded images using a trained ML model.
- Simple and intuitive UI built with Django templates.
- Handles uploaded images and stores them securely.
- Portable and scalable for various environments.
